        <h2> ABOUT ME &hearts;</h2>   
        <p> My name is Davi Jones. I am an aquarius and I'm from Caliiii. My birthday is on the 9th of February. I enjoy listenting to music, it's like my escape from reality. My favorite artists' are Mariah The Scientist, Jhene Aiko, and Summer Walker. I'm really big on making sure I'm always on point. I keep my hair, nails, toes and lashes done. I care a lot about my appearence. I enjoy school, when it's not frustrating me. I LOVE learning and understanding new things. My favorite subject in school is Math.   </p>
        
        <h2> HOBBIES &hearts; </h2>
        <h3> JOURNALING </h3>
        <img src= "https://i.pinimg.com/736x/e9/06/db/e906dbd583c78da857d47ec68b2026e8.jpg">
        <p> Journaling is very good for relaxation and getting all your feelings out. When I write how I feel on paper, It takes away a lot of the stress I've been feeling. I'm natrually an overthinker so journaling helps me stop over thinking and understand myself more. Plus, the more i write, the better my handwriting gets! </p>
        <h3> DANCING </h3>
        <img src= "https://emilyadannunzio.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/aesthetics.jpg">
        <p> Ever since I was 9, I've been into dance. I mean - I'm not suprised since I love music. My auntie had a dance team for abour 4 years and I was the captain. Not because I was her niece but because I was actually skilled, duh. I'm always dancing in my room or in any mirror I walk by. Dancing is so fun especially when you're in a good mood.   </p>
        <h3> COOKING </h3>
        <img src= "https://i.pinimg.com/originals/e7/81/17/e78117c2c872d3f5307e1e11cae4f068.png">
        <p> I don't think there's a person in the world that could dislike cooking! See me, I'm a foodie. I love eating and trying new things, but I also love knowing how to make some of my favorite dishes.Food also lightens my mood, I could be in the worst mood ever but as soon as I get a hold of some food I instantly feel better. There's not much to it, I just love eating and cooking. </p>
